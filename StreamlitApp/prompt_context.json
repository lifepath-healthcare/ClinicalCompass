    "prompt":"What are the common lifestyle modifications recommended for managing Type 2 Diabetes, and what role do oral medications play in its treatment?",
    "context":"Lifestyle modifications are fundamental in the management of Type 2 Diabetes. This includes adopting a healthy eating plan, often focusing on whole foods, limiting refined sugars, and reducing saturated and trans fats. Regular physical activity, such as at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week (e.g., brisk walking, cycling), is highly recommended.Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise is crucial for improving insulin sensitivity. Smoking cessation and limiting alcohol intake also contribute significantly to overall health and diabetes control. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can aid in understanding dietary impacts.When lifestyle changes alone are insufficient to achieve target blood glucose levels, oral medications are often prescribed. Metformin is typically the first-line oral agent, working by reducing glucose production by the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. Other common oral classes include sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists (though some GLP-1s are injectables, some are oral).Insulin therapy may be initiated if oral medications and lifestyle changes do not adequately control blood sugar, or in cases of significant hyperglycemia. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body does not produce insulin, requiring lifelong insulin therapy from diagnosis.The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach that produces insulin. The discovery of insulin in the 1920s revolutionized diabetes treatment. While insulin is vital, this document focuses on Type 2 management.",

They work through various mechanisms to lower blood sugar."
