    Welcome to the **AI Model Evaluation Hub for Clinical Context**!

    This platform is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of various AI model performances,
    including traditional machine learning algorithms and advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
    specifically tailored for clinical applications and healthcare scenarios.

    **What you can do here:**
    - **Explore Model Performance:** Navigate a structured hierarchy of AI models (both traditional and LLM-based) and delve into their performance metrics for specific use cases or prompts.
    - **Analyze Key Metrics:** View detailed metrics for each model, often visualized with radial charts for quick and intuitive understanding of strengths and weaknesses.
    - **Manage Prompt Contexts:** Easily upload and preview JSON files that define the prompt contexts used in LLM evaluations, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

    Our mission is to foster a deeper understanding and transparent evaluation of AI capabilities in healthcare, empowering researchers, clinicians, and data scientists to make informed decisions and advance the integration of AI responsibly.
